Disk Scheduling Algorithm in Python

## Type this first in the Terminal
```
python generate_requests.py 1000 5000 requests.txt
```
This is to generate 1000 series of numbers in the range of 5000
once you've done this once, no need to type this again in the terminal for every Algorithm Testing

## SCAN Algorithm
```
python scan_algorithm.py 1000 requests.txt
```
## C-SCAN Algorithm
```
python c_scan_algorithm.py 1000 requests.txt
```
## FCFS Algorithm
```
python fcfs_algorithm.py 1000 requests.txt
```

## Results from my Machine

- SCAN Algorithm = 8988
- C-SCAN Algorithm = 4995
- FCFS Algorithm = 1687114
